## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the Steering Committee may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

Additionally, Steering Committee members are available to help participants who are experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe, for isntance by providing escorts or contacting law enforcement if it is requested.
