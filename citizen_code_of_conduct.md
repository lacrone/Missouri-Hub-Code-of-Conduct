# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Missouri Hub is to be inclusive to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of ability, age, education, ethnicity, gender identity, race, sexual orientation or other characteristic.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in Missouri Hub to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

  * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
  * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

  * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
  * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  * Sustained disruption of meetings or other Missouri Hub events.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.


## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the Steering Committee may take one or more of the following actions as they deem appropriate:

  * Private, written __warning__ indicating the consequences of continued violation
  * __Temporary ban__ from Missouri Hub sponsored meetings and activities
  * __Permanent expulsion__ from Missouri Hub sponsored meetings and activities

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the chair of the Missouri Hub Steering Committee as soon as possible. 

Current Chair (2020-21): Shannon Mawhiney, [SMawhiney@MissouriState.edu](mailto:SMawhiney@MissouriState.edu)

Additionally, Steering Committee members are available to help participants who are experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe, for instance by providing escorts or contacting law enforcement if it is requested.

Missouri Hub respondents will respect the privacy wishes of reporters and those experiencing unacceptable behavior.

## 6. Scope

We expect all community participants (attendees, leaders, sponsors, and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to Missouri Hub business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members, for instance during MissouriHub social gatherings.
